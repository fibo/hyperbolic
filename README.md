## Description

In Italy we invented pizza, gelato, parmigiano among other things like Perspective, Complex numbers, Non-Euclidean geometry.
Yes, Italy is not only history, art, fashion, design, awesome cars but also a land of great mathematicians.
In particular, [Non-Euclidean geometry][Non-Euclidean_geometry] was first discovered by [Saccheri]
but it was a discovery so amazing at that time that nobody believed it was right, even its creator. We were not ready yet.

Something like two hundred years later [Eugenio Beltrami][Beltrami] discovered the [Pseudosphere] and it was like saying to the world:

> Hey, here it is a surface with negative curvature, it exists and it is real. It makes sense!

Consider that the [Fifth postulate][Parallel_Postulate] was more than two thousands years old,
and that it is assumed as *true* by the human kind.

So a big step forward in geometry was the introduction of an *hyperbolic plane*
model, first with the [Beltrami] model, than the beautiful [Poincaré disk][Poincaré_disk].
